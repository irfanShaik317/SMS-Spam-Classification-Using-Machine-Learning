# SMS-Spam-Classification-Using-Machine-Learning
This project explores the critical issue of SMS spam classification, addressing the growing prevalence of unsolicited and potentially harmful text messages. SMS spam not only disrupts users' communication but can also lead to security risks, such as phishing attacks and malware distributionSMS spam filtering classification is the process of identifying and classifying spam messages received on mobile phones 
It involves analyzing the content and context of the message to determine if it is unwanted or potentially harmful. By using machine learning techniques like natural language processing and deep learning algorithms we can achieve high accuracy rates in distinguishing between spam and legitimate messages enhancing user experience and reducing the impact of unwanted SMS spam.
